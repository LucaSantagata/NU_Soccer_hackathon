A higher value signals that the player consistently delivers passes/set pieces that tend to generate shots, even if the actual shot-assist count swings from match to match. Comparing SHOT_ASSISTS to EXPECTED_SHOT_ASSISTS helps identify over- or underperformance driven by context (e.g., whether teammates actually took the shot) rather than the passer’s underlying contribution.</td>\n",

It reflects how many assists a player would normally be expected to achieve given the quality of their deliveries, independent of whether teammates actually finished the chances. A higher value signals that the player consistently generates passes/set pieces with strong goal-assist potential, making it a fairer indicator of underlying creative contribution than realized assists alone.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Expected passes provide a statistical benchmark for assessing passing performance. By comparing expected passes with a player’s actual successful passes, we can measure whether the player is completing more or fewer passes than the model predicts. To do this, two derived scores are useful: Pass Completion Over Expected and Pass Accuracy Over Expected. These scores capture whether a player is performing above, in line with, or below the expected baseline, and help highlight technical passing skill, decision-making, and ability under pressure. Example: If a player attempts 10 passes and completes 8, while the model predicts 7.5 expected completions, then: Pass Completion Over Expected = (8 – 7.5) / 7.5 = +6.7% and Pass Accuracy Over Expected = (8 – 7.5) / 10 = +5%.</td>\n",

A comparison of (conceded) post-shot xG and (conceded) goals can allow you to make a judgement about the goalkeepers shot stopping performance.

       "100  Expected passes provide a statistical benchmark for assessing passing performance. By comparing expected passes with a player’s actual successful passes, we can measure whether the player is completing more or fewer passes than the model predicts. To do this, two derived scores are useful: Pass Completion Over Expected and Pass Accuracy Over Expected. These scores capture whether a player is performing above, in line with, or below the expected baseline, and help highlight technical passing skill, decision-making, and ability under pressure. Example: If a player attempts 10 passes and completes 8, while the model predicts 7.5 expected completions, then: Pass Completion Over Expected = (8 – 7.5) / 7.5 = +6.7% and Pass Accuracy Over Expected = (8 – 7.5) / 10 = +5%.   \n",

By comparing expected passes with a player’s actual successful passes, we can measure whether the player is completing more or fewer passes than the model predicts. To do this, two derived scores are useful: Pass Completion Over Expected and Pass Accuracy Over Expected. These scores capture whether a player is performing above, in line with, or below the expected baseline, and help highlight technical passing skill, decision-making, and ability under pressure. Example: If a player attempts 10 passes and completes 8, while the model predicts 7.5 expected completions, then: Pass Completion Over Expected = (8 – 7.5) / 7.5 = +6.7% and Pass Accuracy Over Expected = (8 – 7.5) / 10 = +5%.</td>\n",

It reflects how many assists a player would normally be expected to achieve given the quality of their deliveries, independent of whether teammates actually finished the chances. A higher value signals that the player consistently generates passes/set pieces with strong goal-assist potential, making it a fairer indicator of underlying creative contribution than realized assists alone.  \n",
       "8   Expected passes provide a statistical benchmark for assessing passing performance. By comparing expected passes with a player’s actual successful passes, we can measure whether the player is completing more or fewer passes than the model predicts. To do this, two derived scores are useful: Pass Completion Over Expected and Pass Accuracy Over Expected. These scores capture whether a player is performing above, in line with, or below the expected baseline, and help highlight technical passing skill, decision-making, and ability under pressure. Example: If a player attempts 10 passes and completes 8, while the model predicts 7.5 expected completions, then: Pass Completion Over Expected = (8 – 7.5) / 7.5 = +6.7% and Pass Accuracy Over Expected = (8 – 7.5) / 10 = +5%.  \n",
